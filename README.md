>* Based on the above graph, we can see that their was a huge shoot up in car sales but dipped around 2019 due to corona
 
 How could you travel alone without contracting corona? -> your own **Private Vehicle** 
 
 I can confirm this, as I have been in the same industry for 3 years at Harman. It's a growing market with electrification driving the trends. So, **PRICE** is a very important metric for the people to look at cars and buy them.
 
<h2> 1.2 What is the problem? </h2>
 
 The recent pandemic caused by the coronavirus has made people caring about their health so much, that people are preferring to travel in their private vehicles (Car).
 
 So, The Problem statement is that what might be the price of a car ( New / Used ) after 2017? Let it be known that the data can be updated and we expect the model to perform equally well.
 

<h2> 1.3 Interested Party and Reason </h2>

 The interested party who would benefit from this price prediction model is a Pre-owned car sales person or entity like carvana, car.com or vroom.com. For our example, we are designing this model for TempeCarMart, a local car salesman who is establishes since the 90's and want to catch up the latest trend in technology and make more profit( A.K.A Sell Cars)
 
 Advantages of having a ML model with price prediction powers:
  >- The sales person or entity will have a accurate price to set for the pre-owned cars according to the market
  >- During the negotiation of buying a used car, they can use this model to get an idea of how much they can spend to buy that car and make a profit by turnover.
  >- The owner can decide on how much profit he can make, looking at the predicted price with a used car which has been sitting for a long period of time.
